    <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
    <p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>

    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on 
     the way:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
        <li>Why, AZ</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
    <p>Passing cars,<br>
        When you can't see,<br>
        May get you,<br>
        A glimpse,<br>
        Of eternity.</p>
    <p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
    <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.
        Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>cellphone</li>
        <li>iPod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, A journey of a thousand miles begins
        with one Segway.</p>
